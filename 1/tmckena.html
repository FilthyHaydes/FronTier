    <h3>Here's a time line of Terence McKenna;s life:</h3>
   <ul>
     <li><span>1946</span> - Terence McKenna was born on November 16, in Paonia, California. His a mother of Welsh descent and his father had Irish ancestory .</li>
     <li><span>1963</span> - he read books like ‘The Doors of Perception’ and ‘Heaven and Hell’ by Aldous Huxley, which kindled his interest on psychedelics and naturally-occurring psychedelic substances. It is believed that his interest in the subject got him hooked to smoking cannabis at the age of 17."</li>
     <li><span>1965</span> - he studied art history at the University of California, Berkeley. Two years later, he became involved in studying ‘shamanism’ and traveled to Jerusalem, where he met his future wife, Kathleen Harrison."</li>
     <li><span>1969</span> - inspired by his study and hallucinogenic experiences, he traveled to Nepal, where he worked for a brief period of time as a hashish smuggler.</li>
     <li><span>1971</span> - he traveled to the Amazon with his friends where they tried to look for a certain plant called, ‘oo-koo-he’</li>
     <li><span>1972</span> - he returned to Berkeley to finish his education and graduated from there three years later. Right after his graduation, he co-authored a book on his Amazonian experiences titled, ‘The Invisible Landscape: Mind, Hallucinogens and the I Ching’.</li>
     <li><span>1980</span> - he began giving public speeches on psychedelic drugs and also started conducting workshops on the same, where he stressed on the importance of ‘felt experience’.</li>
     <li><span>1985</span> - he co-founded the renowned ethnobotanical institution, ‘Botanical Dimensions’, along with his wife, Kathleen, in Hawaii.</li>
     <li><span>1993</span> - his views of hallucinogenic experiences and psychedelic drugs were collated and published in ‘True Hallucinations’, which made him extremely famous amongst those who were active in the rave scene.</li>
     <li><span>2000</span> -  He was 53 and lived on the South Kona Coast of Hawaii. The cause of death was brain cancer, said a publicist for his books.
''If psychedelics don't ready you for the great beyond, then I don't know what really does,'' Mr. McKenna said in December in one of his last public speeches, at the Esalen Institute. Death, he said then, felt close.</li>
     <h4>"One of his greatest works is the ‘Novelty Theory’ developed by him. His initial experiences with psilocybin, DMT, LSD, mushrooms and other hallucinogens led to the development of this theory. It expounds that Mother Nature conserves newness, as observed by an omnipresent timeline that initiates with comparatively minuscule atomic arrangements vaulting through space into more multipart forms like human beings."</h4>
